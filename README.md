## Installation

For this first login to putty(SSl command line) and hit cd / and follow below steps:
Login through putty and hit cd /
Execute all commands by root:
1.	sudo su root 
Now we will execute commands step by step:
2. grep "multiverse" /etc/apt/sources.list
3. echo "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
4. sudo apt-get update
5. sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
   Install apt-get key for BigBlueButton
6. wget https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/repo/bigbluebutton.asc -O- |
7. sudo apt-key add –
8. sudo apt-get update
9. sudo apt-get install bigbluebutton
10. sudo bbb-conf –restart

<b>Assign the hostname</b><br>
This is the place where we are going to assign the domain name/ IP address where actual BigBlueButton will start
Now for this we have to check the IP via ping command whether it is running or not:
Eg. ping <domain/ip>
Eg2. ping demo.bigbluebutton.org
Eg3. ping 87.98.148.253 (it should return the address maybe non-stop)  conclusion           IP/domain works 
o/p: should have been like below
64 bytes from 146.20.105.32: icmp_seq=1 ttl=44 time=27.5 ms

Now below command will assign the BBB to that IP/domain
11. sudo bbb-conf --setip <ip/domain>
Eg. sudo bbb-conf --setip 87.98.148.253
Eg2. sudo bbb-conf --setip bbb.datarays.co
Now BigBlueButton is listening to this Domain/IP address and responding to this API requests.
<br><br>

<b>APP Secret Key</b><br>
This is important when some plugin is used in upon BBB eg. moodle mod plugin.<br>
12.	bbb-conf –secret
O/P:<br>
URL(BigBlueButton Server URL): http://87.98.148.253/bigbluebutton/
Secret (BigBlueButton Shared Secret):  831993ae09d236f75481530065ecc357

<br><br>

<b>Install API demos</b><br>
Here we install sample API demos
13. Install: sudo apt-get install bbb-demo
14. Remove: sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo

<br><br>

<b>Assign the hostname</b><br>
<br><br>
<b>Install Client self-check</b><br>
Here we actually check the drivers of the BBB which are working. Note all should work in order to run video conferencing
15. Install: sudo apt-get install bbb-check
<br>
Link – website_assigned_hostname/check
Eg. http://87.98.148.253/check/
16. Remove - sudo apt-get purge bbb-check

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bigbluebutton-setup/vGvOkDZ-v_8 

// works fine for the IP address
For checking the server:
18. sudo bbb-conf –check
